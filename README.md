Experimental Pterodactyl egg for Necesse 

# Main functions:
Spins up a server with some flags (slots, port, worldname) controlled through env-variables - be sure to specifcy them.


Creates a config file in /cfg/ but this one's ignored by the server. I cannot figure out the Pterodactyl config parser for now so this might need some future enhancements.
